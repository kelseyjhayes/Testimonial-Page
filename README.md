### What I learned

I followed Kevin Powell's YouTube tutorial while completing this challenge, becaue I wanted to gather new ideas about about how to style elements more efficiently using utility classes and components rather than styling each element individually. 

This was a helpful experience, as I'll be able to take those lessons forward into new designs that I'll develop without assistance. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the Easy Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - Kevin Powells video tutorial gave me new insights into how to use CSS more efificiently, as well as providing some great tips about CSS grid such as grid-template-areas.
