## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I followed Kevin Powell's YouTube tutorial while completing this challenge, becaue I wanted to gather new ideas about about how to style elements more efficiently using utility classes and components rather than styling each element individually. 

This was a helpful experience, as I'll be able to take those lessons forward into new designs that I'll develop without assistance. 

### Useful resources
